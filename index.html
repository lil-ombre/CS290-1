        <p>Ive taken a web development course at LBCC before and the most advanced thing I
            developed was a color changing background that changed color when the mouse hovered over it.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to develop more skills in java and understand surver side programming more and see what
            creative things can be done in web development.
        </p>
        <P>I have also created an account on campuswire!</P>
        <P>A few interesting facts about me are that I use to skate a lot and I picked up a few
            skills in music production.
