            For my first web development assignment I learned to implement the basics in html and got my webpage 
            looking pretty good. The most difficult part of the assignment for me was using git and implemting git commands 
            in the terminal. I ended up looking up instructions online and learned a few git commands and also learned
            to create files and commit them on the github website itself wich made things a lot easier. I have taken
            a web development class before so Im pretty comfortable coding in html, like I mentioned earlier
            the most difficult thing for me was using git but I learned to get things added and commited. I 
            used instructions found on the github website wich was really helpful and datacamp.com was very 
            helpful as well. I also got help on campuswire with cloning a repository.
